# github-drama

This is a curated collection of "dramatic" github interactions.

## Contributing to github-drama

Make sure to link to the issue or pull request in your commit message. This causes
a link to the github-drama commit to appear in the dramatic interaction, if it
hasn't been locked yet. That way, the participants of the drama know that they're
being dramatic. This can have a number of effects on a person:

* They realize they're being dramatic, and take a step back from the drama. This
  reduces their anxiety and blood pressure.
* They're embarrassed that they've been called out as being dramatic.

### What qualifies as drama?
There's no agreement on what's considered dramatic enough to be included
in github-drama. Everyone has a different sense of humor. There are plenty
of "non-serious" github threads, where the usual github politeness gave
way to reaction gifs and one-word replies, turning into something like a
4chan thread but less funny.

This repository follows the guideline that if anyone in the thread appears to
be getting worked up about something, it can be considered for inclusion here.
If a repository's maintainer has locked conversation on a thread, that's also
a good indicator that it could be included here.
